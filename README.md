# test
This is my first Github experiment. Just taking a stroll through the platform to get an idea of how this works.
I'm interested in making interactive web pages with JavaScript and jQuery. This is a project that I found while doing research and I started dissecting it and putting in comments to better understand how it works. That is something I like to do when I have a little time.

This tests whether an element is in the viewport and then acts accordingly.
